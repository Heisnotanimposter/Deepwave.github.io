        <h2>Learning about the three fundamental tree traversals</h2>  
        <pre style ="white-space: pre-wrap;">Given Tree Structure:

      A
     / \
    B   C
   / \   \
  D   E   F
         /
        G
1. Preorder Traversal (Root -> Left -> Right):

Start at the root (A).
Visit the root: A
Traverse the left subtree (rooted at B):
Visit the root (B): B
Traverse the left subtree (rooted at D):
Visit the root (D): D
Left subtree of D (none)
Right subtree of D (none)
Traverse the right subtree (rooted at E):
Visit the root (E): E
Left subtree of E (none)
Right subtree of E (none)
Traverse the right subtree (rooted at C):
Visit the root (C): C
Traverse the left subtree of C (none)
Traverse the right subtree (rooted at F):
Visit the root (F): F
Traverse the left subtree (rooted at G):
Visit the root (G): G
Left subtree of G (none)
Right subtree of G (none)
Right subtree of F (none)
Preorder Traversal Result: A -> B -> D -> E -> C -> F -> G

2. Postorder Traversal (Left -> Right -> Root):

Traverse the left subtree (rooted at B):
Traverse the left subtree (rooted at D):
Left subtree of D (none)
Right subtree of D (none)
Visit the root (D): D
Traverse the right subtree (rooted at E):
Left subtree of E (none)
Right subtree of E (none)
Visit the root (E): E
Visit the root (B): B
Traverse the right subtree (rooted at C):
Traverse the left subtree of C (none)
Traverse the right subtree (rooted at F):
Traverse the left subtree (rooted at G):
Left subtree of G (none)
Right subtree of G (none)
Visit the root (G): G
Right subtree of F (none)
Visit the root (F): F
Visit the root (C): C
Visit the root (A): A
Postorder Traversal Result: D -> E -> B -> G -> F -> C -> A

3. Inorder Traversal (Left -> Root -> Right):

Traverse the left subtree (rooted at B):
Traverse the left subtree (rooted at D):
Left subtree of D (none)
Visit the root (D): D
Right subtree of D (none)
Visit the root (B): B
Traverse the right subtree (rooted at E):
Left subtree of E (none)
Visit the root (E): E
Right subtree of E (none)
Visit the root (A): A
Traverse the right subtree (rooted at C):
Left subtree of C (none)
Visit the root (C): C
Traverse the right subtree (rooted at F):
Traverse the left subtree (rooted at G):
Left subtree of G (none)
Visit the root (G): G
Right subtree of G (none)
Visit the root (F): F
Right subtree of F (none)
