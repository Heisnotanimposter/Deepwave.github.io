        <h2>Learning about The instruction cycle</h2>  
        <pre style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Today I learned about...The instruction cycle, also known as the fetch-decode-execute cycle, is the fundamental process by which a computer's central processing unit (CPU) retrieves and executes instructions from memory. It's the core operation that allows computers to run programs. Here's a breakdown of the key stages:

1. Fetch Stage:

Purpose: To retrieve the next instruction from main memory.
Process:
The program counter (PC) holds the memory address of the next instruction.
The CPU fetches the instruction from that memory address.
The fetched instruction is stored in the instruction register (IR).
The program counter (PC) is then incremented to point to the next instruction in sequence.
2. Decode Stage:

Purpose: To interpret the instruction and determine what actions the CPU needs to take.
Process:
The control unit (CU) decodes the instruction in the instruction register (IR).
The control unit identifies the operation to be performed and the operands involved.
The control unit generates the necessary control signals to activate the appropriate CPU components.
3. Execute Stage:

Purpose: To perform the specified operation.
Process:
The CPU executes the instruction, using the arithmetic logic unit (ALU) for arithmetic and logical operations.
Data may be read from or written to memory or registers.
The results of the operation are stored in registers or memory.
Depending on the instruction, the program counter (PC) may be modified (e.g., for jumps or branches).
Key Components Involved:

Program Counter (PC): Holds the address of the next instruction.
Instruction Register (IR): Holds the current instruction being executed.
Control Unit (CU): Decodes instructions and generates control signals.
Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU): Performs arithmetic and logical operations.
Memory Address Register (MAR): Holds the memory address to be accessed.
Memory Data Register (MDR): Holds data being read from or written to memory.
In essence:

The instruction cycle is a continuous loop that the CPU repeats to execute a program. The CPU fetches, decodes, and executes instructions one after another, or in modern processors, with pipelining, several instructions at the same time. This process continues until the program is finished or the computer is shut down.
