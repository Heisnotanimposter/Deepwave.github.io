        <h2>Data Link layer </h2>  
        <pre style ="white-space: pre-wrap;">Today i learned about...OSI 7-Layer Model: Data Link Layer (Layer 2)

The Data Link layer is the second layer in the OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model, situated between the Physical layer (Layer 1) and the Network layer (Layer 3). Its primary role is to ensure reliable, error-free transfer of data between adjacent nodes (devices) on a local network.

Key Responsibilities:

Framing:
The Physical layer sends raw bitstreams. The Data Link layer organizes these bits into logical, structured units called "frames." These frames include:
Header: Contains source and destination MAC addresses, control information.
Payload: The actual data being transmitted.
Trailer: Error detection/correction information.
Physical Addressing (MAC Addressing):
It uses Media Access Control (MAC) addresses, which are unique hardware addresses assigned to network interface cards (NICs).
MAC addresses enable the layer to identify and communicate with specific devices within the local network.
Error Detection and Control:
The Data Link layer detects and, in some cases, corrects errors that occur during transmission.
Techniques include:
Checksums: Used to detect data corruption.
Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC): A more robust error detection method.
Acknowledgement/Retransmission: In some protocols, the receiver acknowledges successful frame delivery, and the sender retransmits lost or corrupted frames.
Flow Control:
It regulates the rate of data transmission between devices to prevent a fast sender from overwhelming a slow receiver.
This ensures that data is not lost due to buffer overflows.
Media Access Control (MAC):
In shared media environments (like older Ethernet or Wi-Fi), the MAC sublayer manages how devices share the physical medium.
Protocols like CSMA/CD (Ethernet) or CSMA/CA (Wi-Fi) are used to prevent collisions and ensure fair access.
Node-to-Node Delivery:
It focuses on delivering frames between directly connected devices, not across entire networks. This is a local area network (LAN) function.
Sublayers:

The Data Link layer is often divided into two sublayers:

Logical Link Control (LLC):
Handles logical addressing, flow control, and error control.
Provides an interface to the Network layer.
Media Access Control (MAC):
Manages access to the physical medium and handles physical addressing (MAC addresses).
Interacts directly with the Physical layer.
Examples of Data Link Layer Protocols:

Ethernet: The most common LAN technology.
Wi-Fi (802.11): Wireless LAN standard.
PPP (Point-to-Point Protocol): Used for direct connections between two devices.
HDLC (High-level Data Link Control): Used in various communication protocols.
