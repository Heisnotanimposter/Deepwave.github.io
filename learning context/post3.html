        <h2>Typical HDLC Frame Structure</h2>  
        <pre style ="white-space: pre-wrap;">Typical HDLC Frame Structure:

Flag:
This is an 8-bit sequence (01111110) that marks the beginning and end of an HDLC frame.
It's used for frame synchronization, allowing the receiver to identify the start and end of a transmission.
Address Field:
This field contains the address of the secondary station (or stations) involved in the communication.
The length of this field can vary.
Control Field:
This field contains control information, such as:
The type of HDLC frame (I-frame, S-frame, or U-frame).
Sequence numbers for flow and error control.
The length of this field can be 1 or 2 bytes.
Information Field (Payload):
This field carries the actual user data being transmitted.
Its length is variable. It may not be present in all HDLC frames (e.g., S-frames).
Frame Check Sequence (FCS):
This field contains a Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) value.
The CRC is used for error detection. The receiver calculates its own CRC and compares it to the received FCS to verify data integrity.
Typically 16 bits, but can be 32 bits.
Flag:
A closing flag, that is the same sequence as the opening flag.
Key Considerations:

Bit Stuffing:
HDLC uses bit stuffing to prevent data within the frame from being mistaken for flag sequences.
The sender inserts a "0" bit after any sequence of five consecutive "1" bits within the frame (excluding the flags).
The receiver removes these inserted "0" bits.
Frame Types:
HDLC defines three main frame types:
I-frames (Information frames): Carry user data.
S-frames (Supervisory frames): Used for flow and error control.
U-frames (Unnumbered frames): Used for control and management functions.</pre>
