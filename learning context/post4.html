        <h2>UNIX kernel</h2>  
        <pre style ="white-space: pre-wrap;">UNIX kernel:

The Unix kernel is the core part of the operating system, acting as a bridge between hardware and software and managing all major functions of the system. Its main roles are as follows:

1. Process Management:

Process Creation and Destruction: Creates new processes and terminates processes that are no longer needed.
Process Scheduling: Assigns CPU usage time to each process so that multiple processes can share the CPU efficiently. Implements various scheduling algorithms (e.g., round robin, priority-based).
Process Synchronization and Communication: Provides mechanisms for multiple processes to safely access shared resources and exchange information with each other (e.g., semaphores, mutexes, pipes, sockets).
Process State Management: Tracks and manages the state changes of processes (created, ready, running, waiting, terminated).
2. Memory Management:

Virtual Memory Management: Makes it appear as if each process uses a larger memory space than the actual physical memory size. This allows multiple processes to share memory efficiently and alleviates the problem of running out of physical memory (paging, segmentation). Physical memory allocation and release: Allocates physical memory space required by the process, and reclaims memory space that is no longer in use.
Memory protection: Protects each process to access only its allocated memory area, preventing it from invading other processes or kernel areas.
3. File System Management:

File and Directory Management: Supports basic file system operations such as creating, deleting, renaming, and moving files and directories.
File Access Control: Maintains security by managing read, write, and execution permissions for files.
Storage Device Management: Recognizes and manages storage devices such as hard disks and SSDs, and provides functions to mount/unmount file systems.
Maintaining Data Integrity: Provides mechanisms to maintain file system consistency and data integrity.
4. Device Driver Management:

Provides hardware interfaces: Provides interfaces for communicating with various hardware devices such as keyboards, mice, printers, and network cards.
Device Driver Loading and Management: Loads and manages required device drivers, and mediates communication between user programs and hardware. Input/Output (I/O) Request Processing: Receives input/output requests from user programs, transfers them to the corresponding hardware devices, and returns the results to the user programs.
5. Providing a System Call Interface:

Interface between user mode and kernel mode: Provides a path for user programs to use kernel functions.
Access to operating system functions: Provides core functions of the operating system, such as process creation, file access, and memory allocation, to user programs through system calls.
In summary, the UNIX kernel efficiently and safely manages the core resources of the system (CPU, memory, file system, and peripheral devices) and provides an interface for user programs to use these resources.</pre>
